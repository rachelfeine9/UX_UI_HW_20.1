            <h1>Welcome Message</h1>
            <div>
            <p>At Echo Hill Ranch we seek to foster a community and connection among children and families who have had similar life experiences and are taking similar life journeys. Echo Hill Ranch is a camp 18 miles southwest of Kerrville, TX.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to provide a safe, fun, relaxing, and empowering professional summer camp experience for the children of Gold Star families, immediate family members of a fallen service member who died while serving in a time of conflict, or those of first responders.</p>
            <p>Echo Hill Ranch gives children the ability to experience nature at its very best! Wallace Creek is a natural spring-fed creek which runs through the camp. Echo Hill, Mount Min, and Mount Baldy can be seen from the main flat. The canyons offer endless hiking opportunities. Cookouts and camping on the South Flat leave lasting memories!</p>
            <p>200+ acres of pristine Texas Hill Country owned by the Friedman family since 1952</p>

            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <p>WHERE DO THE CHILDREN LIVE?</p>
            <p>Housing arrangements are western-style bunkhouses – each with its own bathroom containing sinks, showers, and commodes. Each cabin has hot and cold water. Counselors live in cabins with the children.</p>
            <p>WHERE DO THE CHILDREN SWIM?</p>
            <p>The children will enjoy nearly a mile of Big Foot Wallace Creek, a spring-fed tributary
                of the Guadalupe River. The two main swimming areas are crystal clear waters controlled by rock dams. All waterfront activities are overseen by well-trained staff.</p>
            <p>IS THERE HORSEBACK RIDING?</p>
            <p>Yes – children ride on horses from a carefully selected string appropriate for new riders.
                The horseback riding program is managed by professional riding staff to care for the horses properly and ensure the children have the training and equipment to ride safely.</p>
            <p>WHERE DO THE CHILDREN EAT?</p>
            <p>All meals are prepared on-site by certified and experienced staff. Children eat family
                style with their bunkhouse groups. Meals are balanced and healthy while including favorites such as fried chicken, spaghetti, and pizza. Dinner is typically served in an outside picnic area with hot dogs, hamburgers, a veggie option, and ice-cold watermelon.</p>
            <p>WHO ARE THE STAFF?</p>
            <p>Camping professionals with extensive experience are the program leaders. Each special activity is taught by experts. Staff have experience with Echo Hill Ranch, camping, and counseling. The camp has a fully equipped infirmary with a nurse on staff and a doctor on call.</p>
